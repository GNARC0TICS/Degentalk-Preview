# Degentalk Test & Quality Report

Generated: $(date)

## Executive Summary

The Degentalk codebase shows significant quality issues that need immediate attention before production deployment:

- **Build Status**: ❌ FAILING (426 TypeScript errors in server, 93 in client)
- **Test Coverage**: ❌ NOT MEASURABLE (test infrastructure broken)
- **Cross-Package Imports**: ✅ PASSING (boundaries validated)
- **E2E Tests**: ❌ BROKEN (Playwright not configured)

## Test Infrastructure Status

### 1. Unit Tests

**Client Tests (Vitest)**
- Status: ❌ BROKEN
- Error: Cannot find package 'vitest' imported from @testing-library/jest-dom
- Test Files Found: 4 files in `client/src/__tests__/`
- Configuration: `client/vitest.config.ts` exists but misconfigured

**Server Tests (Vitest)**
- Status: ❌ NOT RUNNING
- Test Files Found: 12 test files across various domains
- Issue: Import path errors preventing test execution

### 2. E2E Tests (Playwright)

- Status: ❌ NOT CONFIGURED
- Test Files: 6 E2E test files in `tests/e2e/`
- Issue: No `playwright.config.ts` found
- Error: Cannot find package '@playwright/test'

### 3. Integration Tests

- Status: ❌ BROKEN
- Location: `tests/integration/webhook.test.ts`
- Issue: Missing 'chai' dependency

## Build Issues Summary

### Server Build Errors (426 total)

**Major Categories:**
1. **Import Errors**: 
   - Missing exports from @shared/types (toMessageId, AuthorId, etc.)
   - Repository pattern violations
   - Incorrect logger imports

2. **Type Mismatches**:
   - Cache decorator type errors
   - Event system type conflicts
   - API response type issues

3. **Schema Issues**:
   - Missing 'content' field on threads table
   - Transaction table 'transactionId' field missing
   - Multiple foreign key constraint errors

### Client Build Errors (93 total)

**Major Categories:**
1. **Missing Type Exports**:
   - XpConfig, MentionThread, Thread types
   - RoleEntity, RoleFormData missing

2. **Component Type Errors**:
   - Forum structure properties missing
   - User properties (isOnline, displayName) missing
   - Post author role properties missing

3. **API Integration Issues**:
   - Incorrect UserId/BadgeId type conversions
   - API response type mismatches

## Cross-Package Import Validation

✅ **PASSING** - All workspace boundaries are valid

**Dependency Graph:**
```
client (L2) → [shared]
server (L2) → [db, shared]
shared (L0) → [none]
db (L1) → [shared]
scripts (L3) → [db, shared]
```

## Script Validation Results

❌ **FAILING** - Multiple validation scripts broken:

1. Import Validation - Module not found errors
2. Migration Safety - Script path errors
3. Forum FK Consistency - Missing validation script
4. TypeScript Compilation - Both client and server failing
5. ESLint Check - Command not found

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### 1. Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Fix vitest configuration in client
- [ ] Configure Playwright for E2E tests
- [ ] Install missing test dependencies
- [ ] Fix test file imports

### 2. TypeScript Errors
- [ ] Resolve 426 server TypeScript errors
- [ ] Fix 93 client TypeScript errors
- [ ] Update shared type exports
- [ ] Fix schema mismatches

### 3. Build Pipeline
- [ ] Fix validation scripts in scripts/
- [ ] Update build configuration
- [ ] Add proper test coverage tooling
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority**: Fix TypeScript build errors before attempting to run tests
2. **Test Strategy**: Once build is fixed, implement proper test coverage with:
   - Unit tests: Target 80% coverage
   - Integration tests: Cover all API endpoints
   - E2E tests: Cover critical user journeys
3. **Quality Gates**: Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent future build breaks
4. **Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md with proper test commands once fixed

## Commands That Should Work (Once Fixed)

```bash
# Unit tests with coverage
pnpm -r test -- --coverage

# E2E tests  
pnpm test:e2e

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Full validation
pnpm validate
```

## Conclusion

The codebase is currently in a non-deployable state with critical build and test infrastructure failures. Immediate action is required to stabilize the build before any feature development or deployment can proceed.
