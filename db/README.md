# Database (DB) Layer

This directory contains all database-related files, including schema definitions, migration scripts, and Drizzle configuration.

## Structure:

- `db/schema/`: Contains the Drizzle ORM schema definitions, organized by domain.
- `db/index.ts`: The main entry point for the Drizzle database client.
- `migrations/`: Database migration files generated by Drizzle Kit.

## Key Files:

- `drizzle.config.ts`: Configuration for Drizzle Kit, specifying schema location and migration output.
- `db/schema/index.ts`: Re-exports all individual schema files for easy import via the `@schema` alias.

## Usage:

- **Schema Definitions:** Define your database tables and relationships in `db/schema/`.
- **Migrations:** Use Drizzle Kit to generate and apply migrations when your schema changes.
- **Database Access:** Import the `db` instance from `@db` to interact with the database.
