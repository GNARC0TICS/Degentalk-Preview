# Manual TypeScript Error Discovery Log

## Discovery Session: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

### Methodology
1. Go through each domain in `server/src/domains/`
2. Check individual files with `npx tsc --noEmit [file]`
3. Categorize errors using ERROR_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md categories
4. Document file paths, error codes, and descriptions

## Error Discoveries

### Category A: Critical Infrastructure Issues

#### A1.1: Path "2" Resolution Issue
**Status**: ACTIVE - Blocking systematic analysis
**Files Affected**: All domains (via tsc compilation)
**Error**: `TS6231: Could not resolve the path '2'`
**Impact**: Critical - prevents accurate error counting
**Next Action**: Need to resolve this before continuing systematic analysis

---

## Discovery Strategy Adjustment

Due to the persistent path "2" issue blocking TypeScript compilation, we need to:

1. **Fix the root cause** of the path resolution issue first
2. **Alternative approach**: Use ESLint and manual code review for error discovery
3. **Incremental testing**: Fix the path issue, then resume systematic discovery

### Alternative Discovery Methods

#### Method 1: ESLint Analysis
```bash
cd /home/developer/Degentalk-BETA
pnpm lint 2>&1 | grep "error" > eslint-errors.txt
```

#### Method 2: Manual Code Review
- Look for common patterns: direct DB imports, missing types, etc.
- Use grep to find specific anti-patterns
- Review recent changes that might have introduced errors

#### Method 3: Incremental File Testing
- Test individual files outside the main project context
- Use standalone TypeScript compilation
- Build error catalog from known problematic patterns

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Resolve path "2" TypeScript configuration issue
2. **Priority 2**: Resume systematic domain-by-domain error discovery
3. **Priority 3**: Categorize errors using the established framework
4. **Priority 4**: Create focused sprint plans based on discovered categories
