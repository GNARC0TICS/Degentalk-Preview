// This file is being phased out. Schema definitions are now in db/schema/*
// See docs/SCHEMA_REFACTOR_PLAN.md for more details.

// All table definitions, enums, Zod schemas, and types have been moved to their respective domain-specific files under /db/schema/
// This file will be removed or kept empty once drizzle.config.ts is updated to point to db/schema/index.ts

export {}; // Add an empty export to satisfy TypeScript's module requirement if the file is completely empty.
