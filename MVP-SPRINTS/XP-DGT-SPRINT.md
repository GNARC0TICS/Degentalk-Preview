## Implementation Details

### Level Progression System

The system uses an exponential-softened scaling formula:

```javascript
function xpForLevel(n) {
  return Math.floor(500 * n ** 1.5);
}
```

This provides sensible scaling:
- Level 1 = 500 XP
- Level 10 ≈ 15,800 XP
- Level 50 ≈ 176,000 XP
- Level 100 ≈ 1,000,000 XP

### Level Brackets

Levels are organized into meaningful brackets:
- **1-10:** "Surface" - New user starter ranks
- **11-30:** "Core" - Active contributors (subtle perks)
- **31-60:** "Deep" - Reputation leaders (governance privileges)
- **61-99:** "Abyss" - Forum elders (experimental perks)
- **100+:** "Mythic" - Custom badges, access to exclusive areas

This plan focuses on the remaining implementation tasks needed to complete the XP and DGT system.
