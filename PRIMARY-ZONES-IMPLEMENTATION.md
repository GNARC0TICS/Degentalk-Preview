## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

1. **Run Database Seeding**

   ```bash
   npm run sync:forums
   ```

   Or with wipe flag to reset:

   ```bash
   npm run sync:forums -- --wipe
   ```

2. **Verify Database**
   - Check that all zones are created with `type: 'zone'`
   - Verify `pluginData` contains enhanced features
   - Confirm parent-child relationships

3. **Test Frontend Display**
   - Primary zones should appear in CanonicalZoneGrid
   - Zone-specific styling should be applied
   - Navigation should show proper theming

4. **Component Registration** (Future)
   - Create component registry for zone-specific widgets
   - Map component names to actual React components
   - Implement dynamic loading based on zone config

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- **isPrimary** is calculated dynamically (zones without parentId)
- Zone features stored in `pluginData` JSONB field
- Theme classes follow pattern: `zone-theme-{slug}`
- All zone configurations centralized in `forumMap.config.ts`

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Component system not yet implemented (placeholders in config)
- Zone metrics endpoints need implementation
- Staff control features need backend support
- XP multipliers and special rules need enforcement logic

## 📝 Environment Variables Required

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
# Other standard env vars...
```

- [ ] All 6 primary zones visible on home page
- [ ] Each zone has distinct visual styling
- [ ] Sub-forums properly nested under zones
