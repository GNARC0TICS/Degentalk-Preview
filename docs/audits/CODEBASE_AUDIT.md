# Codebase Audit Report

This document summarizes the findings and actions taken during a codebase audit focused on improving maintainability, consistency, and adherence to project standards.

## 1. Configuration Canonicalization

**Objective:** Ensure a single source of truth for all build and tool configurations, as defined in the `config-canonicalization.mdc` rule.

### Issue 1: Duplicate Tailwind CSS Configuration

- **File:** `client/tailwind.config.ts`
- **Problem:** This file contained a full, standalone Tailwind CSS configuration, creating a duplicate of the canonical configuration located at `config/tailwind.config.ts`. This leads to configuration drift and makes maintenance difficult.
- **Action Taken:** The contents of `client/tailwind.config.ts` were replaced with a simple re-export of the canonical configuration:
  ```javascript
  // This file is intentionally kept simple to re-export the canonical Tailwind config.
  // All Tailwind CSS configurations should be defined in the root `config/` directory.
  module.exports = require('../config/tailwind.config');
  ```

### Issue 2: Duplicate Vite Configuration

- **File:** `client/vite.config.ts`
- **Problem:** Similar to the Tailwind issue, this file contained a full Vite configuration, duplicating the canonical version at `config/vite.config.ts`.
- **Action Taken:** The contents of `client/vite.config.ts` were replaced with a re-export of the canonical configuration:
  ```javascript
  // This file is intentionally kept simple to re-export the canonical Vite config.
  // All Vite configurations should be defined in the root `config/` directory.
  module.exports = require('../config/vite.config');
  ```

## Summary

By consolidating these configurations, we have:

- Eliminated configuration drift between the client and the root project.
- Improved maintainability by centralizing all configuration in one place.
- Enforced the project's architectural rule for configuration canonicalization.

This audit has addressed the most critical structural issues related to configuration management. Further audits can now focus on more granular code-level improvements.
