# Degentalk™™ Wallet API Integration Plan

This document outlines the 5-step plan for integrating the Degentalk™™ wallet system with external payment processors and blockchain services.

## 1. API Provider Selection

### Options Analysis
- **TronGrid API**: Native support for USDT-TRC20 transactions, ideal for our use case
- **CCPayments**: Full-featured cryptocurrency payment processor with merchant tools
- **Binance Pay API**: Offers stable exchange rates and multiple currency options

### Selection Criteria
- Transaction fees (favor lower fees)
- API documentation quality and support
- Transaction processing speed
- Security features and compliance
- Webhook support for transaction notifications

### Implementation Timing
- Q2 2025: Evaluate providers with test integrations
- Q3 2025: Select final provider and begin full integration

## 2. Secure Key Management

### Architecture
- Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- Implement multi-layered security for API credential storage
- Use a vault system for production key management

### Security Controls
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- IP whitelisting for admin functions
- Transaction limits and anomaly detection
- Regular key rotation schedule

### Process
- Create separate API keys for development, staging, and production
- Implement least-privilege access model for all API interactions
- Document secure operations procedures for key handling

## 3. Transaction Handling & Verification

### Deposit Flow
1. Generate unique deposit address for each user
2. Monitor blockchain for deposits to user addresses
3. Verify transaction confirmations (minimum 12 blocks)
4. Credit user wallet after sufficient confirmations
5. Store transaction history with full blockchain references

### Withdrawal Flow
1. Validate withdrawal request (amount, address, limits)
2. Implement 2FA for withdrawals above threshold
3. Queue withdrawal for processing
4. Submit to blockchain via API
5. Monitor transaction status until confirmed
6. Update user wallet balance after confirmation

### Batch Processing
- Schedule regular batch processing for withdrawals
- Implement smart fee optimization for network conditions
- Include admin approval flow for transactions above threshold

## 4. Error Handling & Recovery

### Failure Scenarios
- Network timeouts during API calls
- Insufficient gas/fee errors
- Invalid addresses or transaction format errors
- Temporary API provider outages

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Implement idempotent transaction processing
- Store pending transactions in a durable queue
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Manual recovery process for failed transactions
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail

### Monitoring
- Real-time alerts for transaction failures
- Dashboard for monitoring transaction queue health
- Regular reconciliation between internal balances and blockchain

## 5. Testing & Deployment Strategy

### Test Environment
- Dedicated testnet integration environment
- Simulated transaction flow testing
- Load testing for concurrent transactions

### Testing Matrix
- Normal path transaction flows
- Edge cases (zero amount, maximum limits)
- Network outage scenarios
- API version changes
- Security penetration testing

### Staged Deployment
1. Internal alpha with test accounts
2. Limited beta with team wallets
3. Staff-wide testing with real transactions
4. Limited user beta with caps on transaction amounts
5. Full production rollout with monitoring

### Rollback Plan
- Version-controlled API integration code
- Ability to revert to internal wallet system
- Data backup and recovery procedures

## Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Completion | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|
| Provider Selection | Q3 2025 | Provider comparison matrix, test integration |
| Security Implementation | Q3 2025 | Key management system, security audit |
| Transaction System | Q4 2025 | Deposit/withdrawal flows, monitoring system |
| Testing | Q4 2025 | Test cases executed, bugs resolved |
| Deployment | Q1 2026 | Phased rollout, user documentation |

## Success Metrics

- Transaction success rate (target: 99.9%)
- Average processing time (target: <30 minutes for deposits, <12 hours for withdrawals)
- API uptime (target: 99.95%)
- User satisfaction with wallet features (measured via feedback)
- Reduction in manual treasury operations (target: 90% reduction)
