# CCPayment Integration ‚Äî Platform-Level Overview

## üîí What CCPayment Actually Does

CCPayment acts as our crypto deposit and withdrawal processor.
It handles multi-chain address generation, deposit monitoring, and conversion confirmation.
Think of it like our crypto gateway, but not a wallet custodian ‚Äî we still manage balances off-chain.

## üß© Key Logic Components

### 1. Deposit Flow (User Sends Crypto ‚Üí Gets DGT)

1. User selects a coin (e.g. USDT, TRX, ETH) and requests a deposit.
2. Backend calls CCPayment API:

```http
POST /v1/wallet/address/create
```

‚ûú Returns a deposit address tied to the user's CCPayment UID.

3. CCPayment monitors that address.
4. When a deposit arrives, CCPayment calls our webhook:

```http
POST /api/wallet/webhook
```

Payload includes:
- `userId`
- `coin`
- `amount`
- `recordId`
- `txHash`

5. We validate the webhook, then:
   - Convert amount ‚Üí USDT equivalent
   - Credit user with DGT = USDT * 10
   - Log it as a `crypto_deposit` transaction

‚úÖ User now has DGT in their internal wallet.

### 2. Withdrawal Flow (User Withdraws Crypto)

1. User requests withdrawal:
   - Chooses coin + amount
   - Inputs destination address
2. Backend calls:

```http
POST /v1/wallet/withdraw
```

With:
- `userId`
- `coin`
- `amount`
- `toAddress`

3. CCPayment processes the blockchain withdrawal
4. Status updates arrive via webhook:

```http
POST /api/wallet/webhook
```

‚ûú Updates transaction state in our DB (pending ‚Üí completed ‚Üí failed)

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Strategy (Agent Checklist)

- All CCPayment calls are made from `ccpayment.adapter.ts`
- No controller or service should contain raw fetch/axios calls to the API
- Webhook handler is a single endpoint ‚Üí `wallet.controller.ts` handles and routes it
- Internal DGT logic never touches blockchain ‚Äî it's all driven by CCPayment callbacks

---

## üí° Notes

- CCPayment handles currency conversions, so we don't need to track exchange rates
- We rely on their webhook to confirm events ‚Äî not polling
- Webhook must always validate HMAC signature or shared secret (if available)
- All crypto actions resolve into internal DGT transactions for consistency
