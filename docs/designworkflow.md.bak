# Degentalk™™ v2 Frontend Design Workflow

## Project Overview

Degentalk™™ v2 is a next-generation crypto-powered forum with advanced features:
- Wallet integration (TRON/TRC-20 USDT)
- XP leveling system
- Shop economy
- Dynamic tipping and rain systems
- Custom emojis and frames
- User identity paths

The backend core is 90% complete, with all key systems structurally ready. This document outlines our frontend development plan focusing on UI/UX, micro-interactions, and responsive design.

## Design Principles

1. **Modular Component Structure**
   - Components should be reusable and follow atomic design principles
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns between layout, feature, and UI components

2. **Responsive First Approach**
   - Mobile-first design that scales elegantly to desktop
   - Content hierarchy that adapts to different viewport sizes

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Core forum functionality works without JavaScript
   - Enhanced interactions added through layers of interactivity

4. **Performance Focus**
   - Optimize for initial load time and time-to-interactive
   - Implement lazy loading for content beyond the viewport

5. **Accessibility Guidelines**
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Ensure keyboard navigation throughout the application
   - Maintain proper contrast ratios and text scaling
