# Degentalk User Profile Polish Plan (Streamlined)

## Current Status Summary (May 2025)

The user profile system has a solid foundation but requires polish and feature completion before MVP launch. This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete this critical user-facing feature.

### Strengths:
- Clean layout structure with sidebar and tabbed content
- Core user data display (username, role, bio, level, XP)
- Visual elements (FramedAvatar, rarity-based borders)
- Basic social actions (Follow/Unfollow, Whisper)

### Remaining Issues:
- Profile editing is separate and not fully integrated
- Backend data for inventory and relationships uses placeholders
- "Recent Activity" section is non-functional
- Rank calculations use placeholder data
- Social actions incomplete (friend requests, etc.)

## Phase 1: Core Profile Functionality

- **[ ] Implement Profile Editing**
  - Integrate inline editing on the profile page
  - Use `isEditMode` from `ProfileContext` to toggle edit mode
  - Create PUT/PATCH endpoint for saving profile changes
  - Add success/error feedback
  - Files: `client/src/pages/profile/[username].tsx`, `server/profile-routes.ts`

- **[ ] Finalize Inventory Backend**
  - Complete backend logic for fetching user's items
  - Include equipped status and item details
  - Replace placeholder data with real database queries
  - Files: `server/profile-routes.ts`

- **[ ] Complete Relationship Backend**
  - Implement proper data fetching for Friends, Followers, Following
  - Add friend request handling (accept/reject)
  - Files: `server/profile-routes.ts` or new `server/relationships-routes.ts`

- **[ ] Implement Real Rank Calculations**
  - Replace placeholder rank data (Poster, Tipper, Liker)
  - Add database queries to calculate rankings
  - Cache results for performance
  - Files: `server/profile-routes.ts`

## Phase 2: User Experience Enhancements

- **[ ] Build Recent Activity Section**
  - Create API endpoint for fetching recent user actions
  - Design and implement activity feed component
  - Include post creation, reactions, thread participation
  - Files: Create API endpoint, add component to Overview tab

- **[ ] Enhance Inventory UI**
  - Add item equip/unequip functionality
  - Improve visual presentation with rarity indicators
  - Show item details on hover/click
  - Files: Update Inventory tab components

- **[ ] Improve Social Actions UI**

  - Enhance Following/Followers displays
  - Add confirmation dialogs for actions
  - Files: Update Social tab components

- **[ ] Refine Visual Design**
  - Review spacing, typography, and color usage
  - Ensure consistent styling across all profile sections
  - Add subtle animations for interactions
  - Files: Profile-related components and CSS

## Phase 3: Technical Improvements

- **[ ] Refactor Backend Data Access**
  - Standardize to use Drizzle ORM consistently
  - Remove direct SQL queries for maintainability
  - Files: `server/profile-routes.ts`

- **[ ] Clarify Frame/Avatar Logic**
  - Consolidate logic for user's active avatar frame
  - Use consistent references between tables
  - Files: Backend queries and frontend display logic

- **[ ] Verify Mobile Responsiveness**
  - Test profile page on various screen sizes
  - Adjust layouts for optimal mobile experience
  - Files: Profile-related CSS/components

- **[ ] Add Error Boundaries**
  - Implement proper error handling for profile data

## Implementation Priority Order:

1. **First:** Profile editing and real data connections
2. **Second:** Recent activity and inventory enhancements
3. **Third:** Social features and UI refinements
4. **Fourth:** Technical improvements and responsiveness

These changes will create a polished, functional user profile system that serves as a core feature of the Degentalk platform.
