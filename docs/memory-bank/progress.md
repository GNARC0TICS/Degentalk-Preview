## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Backend Issues

1. **Authentication Gaps**
   - Development authentication bypass in use
   - Missing session management
   - Incomplete role permission checks

   ```typescript
   // From auth.ts - development bypass that needs replacement
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
     return next();
   }
   ```

2. **API Implementation Inconsistencies**
   - Some endpoints defined but not implemented
   - Inconsistent error handling patterns
   - Missing validation on some routes

3. **Database Access Patterns**
   - Some direct database access instead of repository pattern
   - Inconsistent transaction handling
   - Query optimization needed for complex operations

### Frontend Issues

1. **Mock Data Usage**
   - Many components use mock data instead of API calls
   - Fallbacks used where APIs should be connected

   ```typescript
   // Example from wallet-modal-v2.tsx - fallback data
   const wallet = walletData || {
     dgtPoints: 0,
     dgtWalletBalance: 0,
     walletBalanceUSDT: 0,
     walletAddress: '',
     pendingWithdrawals: []
   };
   ```

2. **Placeholder Components**
   - Critical pages using placeholder content
   
   ```tsx
   // From App.tsx - placeholder components
   const ForumPage = () => <div className="p-8 text-center">Forum page coming soon!</div>;
   const ShopPage = () => <div className="p-8 text-center">Shop page coming soon!</div>;
   // ... etc.
   ```

3. **UI Consistency Issues**
   - Inconsistent loading state handling
   - Error display patterns vary
   - Mobile responsiveness issues in some components

## May 2, 2025 — Codebase Structure & Modularity Audit

- See `activeContext.md` for a full summary of the May 2025 audit on structure, modularity, and best practices.
- Key recommendations:
  - Move all context/legacy files to `/docs/`, `/docs/memory-bank/`, or `/archive/`.
  - Modularize all features and UI components.
  - Centralize API logic and shared types.
  - Standardize error/loading UI and styling.
  - Add tests and documentation for all critical flows.
- This audit is intended to guide the next phase of refactoring and future-proofing.

This progress tracker will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of development.
