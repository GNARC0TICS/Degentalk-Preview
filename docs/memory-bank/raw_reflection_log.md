TaskRef: "Analyze and fix errors in client/src/pages/_app.tsx"

Learnings:
- Diagnosed 'Cannot find module' errors in `_app.tsx`.
- Identified that `next` and `@tanstack/react-query-devtools` packages were missing from `package.json` and installed them.
- Discovered `AuthProvider` was located in `client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`, not `client/src/contexts/auth-context.tsx` as initially imported. Corrected the import path in `_app.tsx` by leveraging `RootProvider`.
- Confirmed `SiteLayoutWrapper` component was missing using `directory-tree.md` and file searches. Created a new placeholder component `client/src/components/layout/site-layout-wrapper.tsx` including `SiteHeader` and `SiteFooter`.
- Refactored `_app.tsx` to use a central `RootProvider` (from `client/src/providers/root-provider.tsx`) for context management, simplifying the provider structure in `_app.tsx` and aligning with project conventions.
- Utilized `search_files` to locate component definitions and confirm missing files.
- Understood that `RootProvider` is intended as the single source for context provider composition.

Difficulties:
- Initial import paths in `_app.tsx` for `AuthProvider` and `SiteLayoutWrapper` were incorrect or pointed to non-existent files.
- `SiteLayoutWrapper` was entirely missing, not just misplaced.

Successes:
- Systematically diagnosed and resolved multiple import and module-not-found errors.
- Successfully refactored `_app.tsx` to use the intended `RootProvider` and the newly created `SiteLayoutWrapper`.
- The application's entry point (`_app.tsx`) should now be free of the reported TypeScript errors.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: When encountering "Cannot find module" errors for components/contexts, verify:
    1. Package installation (`package.json`).
    2. Correct import path (check `directory-tree.md`, use `search_files` for filename or exported names).
    3. Actual file existence.
- Project Specific: `RootProvider` in this project centralizes context providers; `_app.tsx` should leverage it.

TaskRef: "Fix ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for shared/schema in seed-default-levels.ts"

Learnings:
- Diagnosed `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `shared/schema` when `scripts/db/seed-default-levels.ts` was executed by the backend.
- Confirmed that `shared/schema.ts` was deleted (as it was marked DEPRECATED).
- Identified that the script was attempting to import `levels`, `titles`, `badges`, and `economySettings` from the old path.
- Verified that `db/schema/index.ts` exports these necessary schema objects from their new locations within `db/schema/economy/`.
- Examined `tsconfig.json` to find the path alias `@db/*` which points to the `db/` directory.
- Updated the import statement in `scripts/db/seed-default-levels.ts` from `../../shared/schema` to `@db/schema`.

Difficulties:
- None; the previous "DEPRECATED" note for `shared/schema.ts` was a strong indicator.

Successes:
- Correctly identified the root cause of the module not found error.
- Used project configuration (`tsconfig.json` path aliases) to apply a clean fix to the import path.
- The `seed-default-levels.ts` script should now correctly import its schema dependencies.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: When a file is deprecated and its contents moved, ensure all dependent files are updated to use the new import paths. Check seeder scripts and utility scripts, not just application code.
- Project Specific: Schema definitions are centralized in `db/schema/index.ts` and can be imported using the `@db/schema` alias.

TaskRef: "Fix ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for shared/schema in seed-economy-settings.ts"

Learnings:
- Identified a similar `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `shared/schema` in `scripts/db/seed-economy-settings.ts`.
- Applied the same fix as for `seed-default-levels.ts`: updated the import path for `economySettings` from `../../shared/schema` to `@db/schema`.
- This reinforces the importance of checking all scripts that might have depended on the deprecated `shared/schema.ts`.

Difficulties:
- A user revert of the change during a previous interruption required re-applying the fix after confirmation.

Successes:
- The `seed-economy-settings.ts` script should now correctly import its schema dependencies.
- Both identified seeder scripts with this issue have been addressed.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General: When a core file like a central schema definition is moved/deprecated, systematically check all potential dependents, including utility and seeder scripts, not just main application code.
- Project Specific: Consistent use of `@db/schema` alias for all schema imports from scripts in `scripts/db/`.

TaskRef: "Fix ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for schema imports in various seeder scripts"

Learnings:
- Continued to diagnose `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors related to schema imports in backend scripts called by `server/index.ts`.
- Corrected import path in `scripts/db/seed-xp-actions.ts` from `./utils/schema` to `@db/schema`.
- Corrected import path in `scripts/db/seed-canonical-zones.ts` from `./utils/schema` to `@db/schema`.
- Verified that `scripts/db/create-missing-tables.ts` does not import from `shared/schema` or `@db/schema`, as it uses raw SQL.
- This systematic check of all seeder scripts imported by `server/index.ts` should resolve the persistent `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `shared/schema`.

Difficulties:
- The error message from `server/index.ts` was generic and didn't pinpoint the exact script causing the issue after the initial fixes, requiring a systematic check of all imported seeders.

Successes:
- All identified seeder scripts (`seed-default-levels.ts`, `seed-economy-settings.ts`, `seed-xp-actions.ts`, `seed-canonical-zones.ts`) now use the correct `@db/schema` import path.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: When a common import path is refactored (e.g., `shared/schema` to `@db/schema`), perform a global search for the old path to find all instances, including those in utility or helper scripts within script directories (e.g. `./utils/schema` which might have been an old local copy or incorrect reference).
- Project Specific: Ensure all database-related scripts consistently use the `@db/schema` alias for Drizzle schema objects.

TaskRef: "Resolve Environment Variable Loading Issue in Node.js/tsx Backend"

Learnings:
- Understood the execution order of ES Module imports in Node.js and how it can affect the timing of `dotenv` loading if `dotenv.config()` is not called before other modules that depend on environment variables are imported.
- Realized that using the Node.js `-r` (`--require`) flag with `tsx` to preload an ESM script (like `server/config/loadEnv.ts`) can lead to `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`. This likely occurs because Node's default CommonJS loader attempts to process the ESM script before `tsx`'s ESM handling is fully in effect.
- Confirmed the recommended solution: explicitly import the environment loading script (`server/config/loadEnv.ts`) for its side effects as the very first line in the main application entry point (`server/index.ts`). This ensures it runs within `tsx`'s ESM context and before any other application logic.
- Addressed a TypeScript error (`Expected 1 arguments, but got 2`) related to `server.listen()` in `server/index.ts` by separating the callback into a `server.on('listening', ...)` event handler.

Difficulties:
- The initial attempt to use `tsx -r ./server/config/loadEnv.ts` in `package.json` scripts failed due to the ESM/CommonJS loader conflict.
- A TypeScript error concerning `server.listen()` arguments appeared after modifying `server/index.ts` for the primary task, requiring an additional fix. The error message persisted in the UI even after the code seemed correct, suggesting a potential stale checker issue.

Successes:
- Successfully modified `server/index.ts` to import `server/config/loadEnv.ts` as the first line, ensuring environment variables are loaded before other modules.
- Successfully updated `package.json` to remove the `-r ./server/config/loadEnv.ts` flag from the relevant backend scripts.
- The primary issue of `DATABASE_URL must be set` should now be resolved, allowing the server to start correctly.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: For Node.js ESM projects, ensure environment variables are loaded at the absolute beginning of the application's entry point. This is typically achieved by importing a dedicated environment loading script (which uses `dotenv`) for its side effects as the very first import statement. This preempts issues related to import hoisting and module execution order.
- Pattern: When using `tsx` or similar TypeScript execution tools for Node.js, exercise caution with Node.js native flags like `-r` (`--require`) if the script being preloaded uses ESM syntax. The default Node loader might attempt to process it as CommonJS, leading to syntax errors. Direct ESM imports within the `tsx`-processed code are generally safer.
- Project Specific: `server/config/loadEnv.ts` is the designated script for all environment variable loading. `server/index.ts` must import it as its first operation to ensure `process.env` is populated correctly for all subsequent modules, especially `server/src/core/db.ts`.
