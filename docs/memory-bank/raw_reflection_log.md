TaskRef: "Forum Audit Batch 2 - Schema Coherence & Frontend Hotspots"

Learnings:
- Successfully removed `isZone` and `canonical` columns from `db/schema/forum/categories.ts`.
- Generated and applied database migration for the schema change using `pnpm drizzle-kit generate:pg` and `pnpm run db:migrate:Apply`.
- Updated `server/src/domains/forum/forum.service.ts` (`getCategoriesWithStats`, `getThreadDetails`) to derive `isZone` (from `type`) and `canonical` (from `type` and `parentId`) for category data.
- Updated `client/src/contexts/ForumStructureContext.tsx` (`ApiCategoryDataFromApi`, `MergedZone`, `mergeStaticAndApiData`, `flattenApiResponse`) to remove direct usage of `isZone`/`canonical` from API data and derive them based on `type` and `parentId`.
- Confirmed `client/src/utils/forum-routing-helper.ts` correctly handles the derived properties and prioritizes the `type` field.
- Memoized `ThreadCard` component (`client/src/components/forum/ThreadCard.tsx`) using `React.memo` for performance optimization.
- Extracted thread statistics display (view count, post count) from `ThreadCard` into a new sub-component `client/src/components/forum/ThreadStats.tsx` and integrated it.
- Implemented list virtualization in `client/src/features/forum/components/HotThreads.tsx` using `react-window`'s `FixedSizeList` to improve performance of long lists.
- Installed `react-window` and `@types/react-window` as project dependencies.
- Resolved an import error for a non-existent `api` object in `client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` by removing the unused import.
- Verified prop compatibility for `ThreadCard` and `ForumHeader` in consuming pages (`client/src/pages/threads/[thread_slug].tsx`, `client/src/pages/tags/[tagSlug].tsx`, `client/src/pages/forums/[slug].tsx`) after schema and component changes.
- Uncommented `forumSlug`, `parentForumTheme`, and `tippingEnabled` props in `ThreadCardComponentProps` within `client/src/types/forum.ts`.

Difficulties:
- Encountered TypeScript errors in `client/src/contexts/ForumStructureContext.tsx` after initial modifications for deriving `isZone`/`canonical`. This required careful adjustment of type definitions (specifically `MergedZone` to include derived `isZone` and `canonical` booleans) and logic in `mergeStaticAndApiData` (for fallback static zones) and `flattenApiResponse`.
- The `react-window` dependency was initially missing after refactoring `HotThreads.tsx`, leading to a TypeScript error. This was resolved by installing the package and its type definitions.
- Clarified handling of the `prefix` prop for `ThreadCard` in `client/src/pages/threads/[thread_slug].tsx`. The `thread` data from `useThreadZone` provides `prefixId`, while `ThreadCard` expects a `prefix` object. The current implementation where `thread.prefix` is undefined in this context and handled by `ThreadCard` is acceptable for now, as `ThreadCard`'s internal logic (`thread.prefix ?? null`) gracefully handles it.

Successes:
- Followed a systematic approach for schema modification: schema file update -> database migration generation -> database push/apply -> service layer update -> context layer update -> UI component verification.
- Successfully refactored `ThreadCard` (memoization, stats extraction) and `HotThreads.tsx` (virtualization) for potential performance improvements.
- Correctly identified and fixed the unused import issue in `sidebar.tsx`.
- Ensured type consistency for `ThreadCard` props after changes.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General Pattern: When removing boolean flags (e.g., `isZone`, `canonical`) from a database schema in favor of a `type` enum or derived logic, ensure all data-consuming layers (backend services, frontend contexts, UI helper functions) are updated to correctly derive these boolean values from the `type` field and other relevant fields (like `parentId`).
- Project Specific: `react-window` is now a dependency and should be used for virtualizing long lists to enhance frontend performance.
- Project Specific: The `ThreadCard` component now officially accepts `forumSlug`, `parentForumTheme`, and `tippingEnabled` as props, as defined in `ThreadCardComponentProps`.
- Reminder: When introducing new UI libraries or dependencies that have TypeScript implications (e.g., `react-window`), always remember to install both the package itself and its corresponding `@types/` package if available.
