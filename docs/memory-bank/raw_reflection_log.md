TaskRef: "Execute seed-forum-categories.ts script"

Learnings:
- The `tsx` command for running TypeScript scripts might not be globally available, requiring `npx tsx` for execution from `node_modules/.bin`. This aligns with how `db:create-tables` is executed in `package.json`.
- The `seed-forum-categories.ts` script handles existing categories by skipping them or throwing duplicate key errors if the `category_id` already exists, which is expected behavior for idempotent seeding.

Difficulties:
- Initial attempt to run `tsx` directly failed with "command not found". This was resolved by using `npx tsx`.

Successes:
- Successfully executed the `seed-forum-categories.ts` script.
- Confirmed that the script attempts to seed categories and handles existing ones.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When a CLI command is not found, try prefixing with `npx` if it's a package executable.
- Project specific: Seeding scripts might encounter duplicate key errors if run on an already populated database; ensure scripts are idempotent or handle existing data gracefully.

TaskRef: "Fix 'Failed to load forum structure' error"

Learnings:
- Redundant data aggregation in API routes can lead to incorrect data being sent to the frontend, even if the service layer provides correct data. Specifically, re-calculating `threadCount` and `postCount` in the `/api/forum/structure` route after `forumService.getCategoriesWithStats()` had already done so, was overwriting valid counts.
- Frontend components should be robust to handle variations in data, but API responses should be consistent and avoid unnecessary re-processing of data already prepared by service layers.
- The `pluginData` field, defined as `jsonb` in the schema, should consistently be treated as an object (or parsed from a string) throughout the backend and frontend to avoid type mismatches.

Difficulties:
- Diagnosing the issue required tracing data flow from the service layer through the API route to the frontend, identifying where correct data was being inadvertently altered or overwritten.

Successes:
- Identified and removed redundant data aggregation logic in `server/src/domains/forum/forum.routes.ts` for the `/structure` endpoint.
- Ensured `pluginData` is consistently handled as an object.
- Made a minor adjustment to the frontend `Thread` interface in `client/src/pages/forum/[slug].tsx` to reflect the actual data returned by the API.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: Avoid redundant data processing in API route handlers if the service layer already provides the data in the desired format. Trust the service layer's output.
- Project specific: Ensure `jsonb` fields are consistently parsed/stringified at the appropriate layers (service/controller) and consumed as objects in the frontend.
- Project specific: When debugging frontend data loading issues, verify the exact structure and content of the API response at each layer (service, route, frontend consumption).

TaskRef: "Install context-portal MCP server"

Learnings:
- **Identifying Project Type:** The presence of `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` are strong indicators of a Python project, even if a `package-lock.json` exists. Always consult `README.md` for definitive installation instructions.
- **Python Dependency Conflicts (`torch`):** `pip install -r requirements.txt` can fail due to complex dependencies like `sentence-transformers` requiring `torch`.
- **Resolving `torch` Issues:** Installing `torch` separately (`pip install torch`) *before* other dependencies can resolve such conflicts by allowing `pip` to pick a system-compatible `torch` version first.
- **Virtual Environment Executables:** For reliability, especially in chained commands, use the full path to executables within a Python virtual environment (e.g., `/path/to/.venv/bin/pip`).
- **MCP Server Configuration (`cline_mcp_settings.json`):**
    - New servers are added to the `mcpServers` object.
    - Default new server settings: `disabled: false`, `autoApprove: []`.
    - `command` should be the absolute path to the interpreter (e.g., Python in `.venv/bin/python`).
    - The first `arg` should be the absolute path to the server's main script.
    - `${workspaceFolder}` is a useful placeholder for `workspace_id` or relative log paths.
- **Alternative to `uv`:** If `uv` command is not found, fall back to standard Python tools: `python3 -m venv .venv` for virtual environment creation and `pip install` for dependencies.

Difficulties:
- Initial `npm install` failed due to misidentifying the project as Node.js-based.
- `uv` command was not found, requiring a switch to standard Python `venv` and `pip`.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` failed due to `sentence-transformers` and `torch` dependency conflicts.

Successes:
- Successfully cloned the repository.
- Created a Python virtual environment.
- Resolved dependency conflicts by installing `torch` separately.
- Successfully installed all Python dependencies.
- Correctly configured and updated the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file to add the new "conport" MCP server.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When installing Python projects with complex dependencies (especially ML/NLP related), if `requirements.txt` installation fails, try installing problematic core libraries (like `torch`, `tensorflow`) individually first.
- General pattern: Always verify project type from `README.md` or other definitive sources before assuming based on common file names like `package-lock.json`.
- MCP specific: Remember the standard defaults (`disabled: false`, `autoApprove: []`) and path conventions for configuring new MCP servers.
