TaskRef: "Update MVP-SPRINTS/UI_Wiring_Tasks.md with completed items"

Learnings:
- Applying a user-provided diff to a Markdown task list involves:
    1. Reading the current file content (`read_file`).
    2. Constructing the new content by merging the diff with existing relevant sections (e.g., preserving other "remaining tasks").
    3. Writing the new content back to the file (`write_to_file`).
- User-provided diffs are very effective for precise updates to structured text files.

Difficulties:
- Initial response in PLAN MODE did not use a tool when one was needed (to read the file before planning the write operation). Corrected by using `read_file` in the subsequent step.

Successes:
- Successfully updated `MVP-SPRINTS/UI_Wiring_Tasks.md` by incorporating the user's diff and preserving other existing tasks.
- Correctly transitioned from PLAN MODE to ACT MODE after the plan was established and file content was read.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern for updating files based on user-provided diffs: Read existing -> Merge diff -> Write new.
- When in PLAN MODE and file operations are part of the plan, if file content is unknown, use `read_file` to gather information before finalizing the plan and requesting a switch to ACT MODE.
