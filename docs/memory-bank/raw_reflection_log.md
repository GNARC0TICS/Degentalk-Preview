TaskRef: "Fix Forum Navigation Theming and Add Search Route"

Learnings:
- Identified a core issue where direct color values (hex/rgb) were being passed to props (like `colorTheme`) that expected semantic keys for generating CSS class names (e.g., `zone-theme-pit`). This caused styling failures, making links appear broken.
- Reinforced the pattern: Semantic keys for CSS class-based theming; direct color values for inline styles.
- Centralized theme constants (`ZONE_THEMES`, `THEME_ICONS`, `THEME_COLORS_BG`) into `client/src/config/themeConstants.ts` for better maintainability and consistency across components.
- Clarified data flow for theme properties from `ForumStructureContext` (`MergedZone`/`MergedForum`):
    - `colorTheme` property is the semantic key.
    - `icon` and `color` properties (and those within the nested `theme` object) are direct values.
- Verified linking mechanisms:
    - `ZoneCard.tsx` correctly links to `/zones/:slug`.
    - `HierarchicalZoneNav.tsx` correctly links to `/zones/:slug`, `/forums/:slug`, and `/forums`.
    - `client/src/pages/forums/index.tsx` correctly links to `/zones/:slug` and `/forums/:slug`.
- Added a missing route for `/forums/search` in `App.tsx` and created a placeholder `ForumSearchPage` component.
- Corrected an incorrect import path for the `Breadcrumbs` component.

Difficulties & Mistakes (as Learning Opportunities):
- Multiple `replace_in_file` attempts on `HierarchicalZoneNav.tsx` were problematic due to the complexity and interconnectedness of changes, leading to merge conflict markers. Switching to `write_to_file` with the complete, corrected content proved more effective for this specific refactor.
- Initially overlooked that `ZONE_THEMES` was not imported in `client/src/pages/forums/index.tsx` after being centralized.
- Made an incorrect assumption about the `Breadcrumbs` component path.

Successes:
- Successfully diagnosed and addressed the root cause of the theming and perceived navigation issues.
- Refactored `client/src/pages/home.tsx`, `client/src/components/forum/CanonicalZoneGrid.tsx`, `client/src/features/forum/components/HierarchicalZoneNav.tsx`, and `client/src/pages/forums/index.tsx` for consistent theme handling.
- Established a clearer pattern for theme data usage.
- Added foundational support for forum search functionality.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- **General Pattern: CSS Theming Strategy:** Enforce that props intended for CSS class key generation (e.g., `colorTheme="pit"`) receive semantic keys, while props for direct styling (e.g., `accentColor="#FF0000"`) receive actual values to be used in `style` attributes. Avoid mixing these.
- **Project Specific: Degentalk Theme Data Flow:**
    - `MergedZone.colorTheme` / `MergedForum.colorTheme` are the primary semantic keys for `zone-theme-*` and `zone-nav-theme-*` CSS classes.
    - Direct `icon` and `color` properties on `MergedZone`/`MergedForum` (or their nested `theme` objects) should be used for specific overrides or direct rendering (e.g., emoji icons, inline styled colors if necessary).
    - All shared theme definitions (maps of keys to icons, color classes, bg classes) belong in `client/src/config/themeConstants.ts`.
- **Tool Usage Note:** For extensive, multi-part changes within a single file where `replace_in_file` proves difficult or error-prone after a few attempts, consider using `write_to_file` with the full intended content as a more robust alternative.
