## Technical Considerations

### Current Technical Challenges

1.  **Legacy Routes:** Route files directly under `server/` need migration to `server/src/domains/`.
2.  **Duplicate Utilities:** Multiple logging and API client implementations exist and need consolidation.
3.  **Mock Data Usage:** Several frontend components use mock or fallback data.
4.  **Incomplete Error Handling:** Some API calls and UI components lack comprehensive error handling.
5.  **Environment-Specific Code:** Development vs. production code paths need review.
6.  **Placeholder Components:** Many routes point to placeholder components.
7.  **Missing Tests:** Comprehensive testing infrastructure is not yet evident.
8.  **Security Vulnerabilities:** Missing RLS policies and potential transaction handling issues.
9.  **API Integration Gaps:** Many components not yet connected to backend services.
10. **Responsive Design Issues:** Mobile experience needs refinement in some areas.
11. **Data Flow Optimization:** Potential for redundant API calls and inconsistent state management.

### Integration Points Needing Attention

1.  **Backend-Frontend Connection:** Many frontend components aren't properly connected to backend services (Forum, Profile, Shop, XP/DGT).
2.  **Real-time Feature Connections:** WebSocket connection for shoutbox works but needs optimization; real-time updates for other features are missing.
3.  **Wallet-Shop Integration:** Shop purchases need to integrate with DGT wallet system.

## User Experience Considerations

1.  **Navigation Improvement:** Global and mobile navigation needs completion.
2.  **Feedback Systems:** Toast notifications need consistent usage; loading states and error messages need standardization.
3.  **Onboarding Experience:** First-time user flow and guidance are missing.

### Directory Structure Analysis & Classification

*   **Core Structure & Config:** ✅ (95% Complete)
    *   `.clinerules/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `migrations/`: Generally complete.
    *   Config files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.): Solid foundation.
    *   `shared/schema.ts`: ✅ **ACTIVE source of truth.**

*   **Server:** ⚠️ (65% Complete)
    *   Core architecture (`server/src/app.ts`, middleware, router): ✅.
    *   Domain organization (`server/src/domains/`): ⚠️ (Partially complete, migration target).
    *   Legacy routes (`server/admin-*.ts`, `server/wallet-*.ts`, `server/treasury-*.ts`, `server/shoutbox-routes.ts`, etc.): ❌ (Need migration to domain structure).

*   **Client:** ⚠️ (60% Complete)
    *   Core setup (`App.tsx`, contexts, providers): ✅.
    *   Components & pages: ⚠️ (Structure exists but many features incomplete, migration in progress).
    *   UI Library: ✅ (Likely complete).
    *   Feature-specific code (`client/src/features/`): ⚠️ (Varies by feature, migration target).

### Redundancy & Logic Overlap Detection

*   **Duplicate Utilities:** Multiple logging utilities (`server/utils/log.ts`, `server/utils/logger.ts`, `server/src/utils/logger.ts`).
*   **Duplicate API Clients:** Multiple API client implementations (`client/src/core/api.ts`, `client/src/lib/api.ts`, `client/src/lib/api-request.ts`). Standardizing on `apiRequest` from `@/lib/queryClient.ts`.
*   **Duplicate Query Clients:** Potential overlap in query client configurations (`client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`, `client/src/core/queryClient.ts`).
*   **Deprecated Logic:** Files in `archive/`, legacy routes in `server/`, wallet code outside domain structure.

### Launch Readiness Assessment

# Degentalk™ Launch Status

*   ✅ **Fully Built & Functional:** 35% (Core setup, Basic Auth structure, Basic Forum Structure, Schema via Migrations, Routing architecture, UI Lib).
*   ⚠️ **Partially Complete:** 45% (Most Domains: Admin Panels, XP/DGT Logic, Forum Features, Shoutbox, Settings, Shop, Messaging, Missions, Wallet core logic).
*   ❌ **Dead/Deprecated:** 5% (Files in `archive/`, legacy routes/wallet code).
*   🧪 **Experimental or In Progress:** 15% (Wallet Refactor, Admin Analytics, Advanced Engagement Features, Missions, Domain Migration).

**Estimated Launch Readiness: ~55-65%**

### Primary Blockers

1.  **Wallet Integration:** Ongoing refactor and completion of DGT/USDT features (tipping, rain, shop purchases, withdrawals, Vault UI). CCPayment integration needs verification.
2.  **Admin Panel Completeness:** Wiring all controls (XP, Treasury, Users, Settings, Reports) to backend logic and ensuring UI functionality. Security hardening.
3.  **XP/DGT/Leveling <-> UI Integration:** Full integration with frontend UI elements (profile display, level-up notifications, progress bars, leaderboards, DGT unlocks).
4.  **Forum Feature Polish:** Completing thread view, creation, posting, and integrating advanced features (solved status, prefixes, tags). Migrating remaining components.
5.  **Authentication System:** Replacing development bypass with real login/registration, session management, and protected route enforcement.
6.  **End-to-End Testing:** Comprehensive testing across all user flows is crucial and likely pending.

### Key Tasks Added to Refactor Tracker

1.  **Complete Wallet Domain Migration & Refactor:** Consolidate wallet routes, services, and utilities into domain structure. Ensure proper CCPayment integration.
2.  **Complete Admin Domain Migration & Integration:** Ensure all admin routes are migrated to domains and UI components properly communicate with backend.
3.  **Complete XP/DGT Domain Implementation & Integration:** Implement backend endpoints and integrate with frontend UI.
4.  **Complete Forum Feature Implementation & Migration:** Implement remaining features and migrate legacy components/routes.
5.  **Implement Full Authentication System:** Replace development bypass with production-ready auth.
6.  **Verify Schema Usage & Resolve Inconsistency:** Address the import from archived `shared/schema.ts` in `server/src/database.ts`.
7.  **Standardize Logging & API Clients:** Consolidate duplicate utilities.
8.  **Complete Missions/Achievements System:** Fully implement mission tracking, rewards, and UI integration.
9.  **Migrate All Legacy Routes:** Move all route files from `server/` to `server/src/domains/`.

### Conclusion

The codebase shows significant progress with a well-defined structure and many core features implemented. The schema is comprehensive and migration paths are clearly defined. However, several critical features (particularly wallet integration, admin controls, XP/UI integration, and Forum completion) need significant work before launch. The ongoing domain migration and cleanup of legacy code are essential steps.

Following the refactor tracker tasks and focusing on the primary blockers should bring the platform to a launchable state. Regular progress updates to this context file will help track advancement toward launch readiness.
