TaskRef: "Forum Routing Refactor - FrontendZoneWiring Step 4 & 5, prefixRegistry, hot-threads endpoint"

Learnings:
- Path alias resolution can differ significantly between server-side (`tsx` with `tsconfig-paths/register`) and client-side (Vite) environments. Fixes for one do not automatically apply to the other.
- `tsconfig.json`'s `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` strictly enforces explicit file extensions (e.g., `.ts`, `.js`) for relative imports in server-side TypeScript. This was a key factor in resolving server-side import errors.
- Client-side alias resolution (Vite + tsconfig paths): Even with correct `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` path aliases, and confirmed file locations, TypeScript errors for aliased imports can occur in components. Switching to relative paths can serve as a workaround, but the root cause of alias misinterpretation by the TS language server (despite Vite's ability to build) should be noted for future investigation.
- The `HotThreads.tsx` component was updated from `/api/forum/hot-threads` to `/api/analytics/hot-threads`.

Difficulties:
- Initial misdiagnosis: Assumed server-side alias fix would cover client-side.
- Server-side imports: Multiple attempts to fix paths in `analytics.routes.ts` due to `nodenext` extension requirements and initial path miscalculations.
- Client-side imports (`HotThreads.tsx`): Persistent TS errors for aliased paths despite seemingly correct setup. Required using relative paths as a workaround.

Successes:
- Successfully created `client/src/constants/prefixRegistry.ts`.
- Successfully created and registered the placeholder API endpoint `/api/analytics/hot-threads`.
- Updated `HotThreads.tsx` to use the new endpoint.
- Resolved all encountered import/path resolution errors through systematic investigation.
- Successfully stubbed the `/api/analytics/hot-threads` route with a detailed static JSON payload.
- Created `client/src/constants/primaryZones.ts` to define zone-specific configurations (icon, description, gradient, etc.).
- Refactored `client/src/components/forum/ZoneCard.tsx` to utilize `primaryZones.ts` for its display logic, including a fallback for missing configurations and updated URL routing for primary zones.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When `moduleResolution` is `nodenext` or `node16`, always add explicit file extensions to relative imports in `.ts` files.
- Troubleshooting alias issues: If aliased paths fail in client components despite correct Vite/tsconfig setup, check for TS language server quirks and consider relative paths as a temporary fix while investigating deeper. Document these instances.
- Project Specific: The `/api/analytics/hot-threads` endpoint is now the source for the `HotThreads` component.
- Project Specific: `client/src/constants/primaryZones.ts` is the new source of truth for `ZoneCard` display properties, distinct from `prefixRegistry.ts` which is for thread-level prefixes.
- Project Specific: `ZoneCard.tsx` now expects a `zoneId` prop and derives its display from the `primaryZones` registry. URLs for these cards point to root `/[slug]`.
