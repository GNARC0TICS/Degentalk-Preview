### [Codebase Restructuring] Phase 1 & 2 Implementation
- **Identified:** 2025-05-19
- **Source Rule(s):** `refactor-rules.mdc`, `naming-rules.mdc`
- **Files Involved:**
    - `memory-bank/*` (entire directory)
    - `server/middleware/auth.ts`
    - `.clinerules/memory-bank.md`
    - `.clinerules/cline-continuous-improvement-protocol.md`
    - `.clinerules/self-improving-cline.md`
- **Actions Completed:**
    - [x] Created `docs/memory-bank/` directory
    - [x] Moved all memory-bank files to `docs/memory-bank/`
    - [x] Updated references in .clinerules files to point to new paths
    - [x] Updated globs in memory-bank.md to include docs/memory-bank/
    - [x] Updated references in memory-bank/consolidated_learnings.md
    - [x] Moved server/middleware/auth.ts to archive/server/middleware/
    - [x] Generated updated directory tree with node scripts/tools/generate-tree.js
- **Reasoning:** Implementing Phase 1 (Archive + Normalize) and Phase 2 (Folder Restructure) of the refactoring plan. Moving memory-bank to docs/ improves organization. Server middleware cleanup aligns with the domain-driven architecture.
- **Status:** DONE
- **Assigned to:** AI Agent
- **Notes:** The middleware/auth.ts file was already marked as deprecated and just forwarded to the canonical implementation, so it was safe to archive. All legacy imports from this file were previously redirected to server/src/domains/auth/middleware/auth.middleware.ts.

### [Naming] Review Vague Utility Files
- **Identified:** 2025-05-13
- **Source Rule(s):** `naming-rules.mdc`, `refactor-rules.mdc`
- **Files Involved:**
    - `client/src/lib/utils.ts`
    - `server/utils/log.ts`
    - `server/utils/logger.ts`
    - `server/utils/*` (other potentially generic utilities)
- **Proposed Actions:**
    - [ ] Review `client/src/lib/utils.ts`: Identify functions. Move domain-specific logic to `client/src/features/{domain}/lib/` or `client/src/features/{domain}/utils/`. Rename if necessary.
    - [ ] Review `server/utils/log.ts` & `server/utils/logger.ts`: Consolidate into a single logging utility (e.g., `server/src/core/logger.ts` or `server/src/utils/logger.ts`). Delete the redundant file.
    - [ ] Review other files in `server/utils/`: Evaluate if they are truly global or belong within a specific `server/src/domains/*` structure. Move and rename as needed.
    - [ ] Update all imports referencing moved/renamed files.
- **Reasoning:** Vague filenames obscure purpose. Central `utils` folders can become bloated. Moving logic to domains improves clarity and modularity.

- **Identified:** 2025-05-13
- **Source Rule(s):** `refactor-rules.mdc` (Domain-Driven Organization)
- **Files Involved:** Files within `server/services/*`
- **Proposed Actions:**
    - [ ] For each service file in `server/services/`, identify the primary domain it serves (e.g., `wallet`, `xp`, `ccpayment`, `core`).
    - [ ] Move the service logic to the appropriate `server/src/domains/{domainName}/services/` directory.
    - [ ] Rename files if necessary for clarity (e.g., `wallet-integration.ts` might become `server/src/domains/wallet/services/integrationService.ts`).
    - [ ] Update all imports referencing the old service paths.
    - [ ] Delete the original files from `server/services/` after migration and testing.
    - [ ] Remove the `server/services/` directory once empty.
- **Reasoning:** Eliminates the legacy top-level `services` directory, enforcing the domain-driven structure for better organization and separation of concerns.
- **Status:** TODO
- **Assigned to:** Agent / User

## Authentication Middleware Cleanup (2023-05-13)

**Status:** Completed

**Description:**  
Centralizing all authentication middleware to use the canonical implementation in `server/src/domains/auth/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` instead of scattered implementations and deprecated locations.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create migration script to update imports (`scripts/auth-refactor.js`)
- [x] Run script to update all imports from deprecated middleware location
- [x] Add explicit deprecation warnings to legacy middleware files
- [x] Verify dev mode and role-switching functionality still works
- [x] Mark the migration as complete in this tracker

**Files Affected:**
- All files importing from `server/middleware/auth.ts` or similar deprecated locations
- The canonical middleware: `server/src/domains/auth/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` 
- Legacy middleware file: `server/middleware/auth.ts`

**Notes:**  
Ensuring both that dev mode bypass and the role-switching functionality is preserved.

    - [x] Update `drizzle.config.ts` to point to `shared/schema.ts`.
    - [x] Update `server/src/database.ts` to remove the incorrect import and add TODOs.
    - [x] Update `client/src/features/forum/components/PostCard.tsx` to import `PostWithUser` from `shared/schema.ts`.
    - [x] Update `client/src/features/forum/components/PostList.tsx` to import `Thread` and `PostWithUser` from `shared/schema.ts`.
    - [ ] Identify all other files importing from `@shared/schema` or `@shared/types`.
    - [ ] Update all imports to point to `shared/schema.ts`.
    - [ ] Run `npm run check` to confirm that all type errors related to schema imports are resolved.
- **Reasoning:** The codebase is in a state of transition, with some parts using the old schema and other parts using the new schema. This is causing type errors and inconsistencies. Resolving this is critical for type safety and development velocity.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Assigned to:** AI Agent
- **Notes:** Renamed the backup schema file and updated imports in key forum components. The `npm run check` command still reports many errors, indicating that the schema import issue is widespread and affects many other files. A comprehensive update of all schema imports is required.
