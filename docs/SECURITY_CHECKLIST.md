# DegenTalk Pre-Launch Security Checklist

## 🚨 CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Launch

### ✅ ID Validation & Type Safety
- [x] Middleware-level ID validation for all routes
- [x] Remove TypeTransformer (security vulnerability)
- [x] Branded ID types enforced everywhere
- [x] UUID validation on all ID parameters
- [ ] Audit all `as` type casts for IDs
- [ ] Add rate limiting on invalid ID attempts

### ✅ Code Cleanup
- [x] Remove all .quotfix backup files (284 files)
- [ ] Remove all console.log statements (595 remaining)
- [ ] Clean up .bak files (29 remaining)
- [ ] Remove commented-out code blocks
- [ ] Delete unused imports and dead code

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Audit all auth middleware usage
- [ ] Verify getAuthenticatedUser() is used everywhere
- [ ] No direct req.user access
- [ ] Session security headers configured
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled on all state-changing routes
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints

### 🛡️ API Security
- [ ] All responses use transformers (no raw DB objects)
- [ ] Input validation with Zod on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (HTML escaping)
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] API rate limiting per user/IP

### 🔒 Data Protection
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] Structured logging only (no console.*)
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded from responses
- [ ] GDPR compliance (data anonymization)
- [ ] Secure file upload validation

### 💰 Payment Security (CCPayment)
- [ ] Webhook signature validation
- [ ] Idempotency keys for transactions
- [ ] Transaction logging and audit trail
- [ ] Amount validation and limits
- [ ] Double-spend prevention
- [ ] Secure wallet private key storage

### 🚀 Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] No secrets in code/config files
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Database connection pooling limits
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info

### 📊 Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Security event logging
- [ ] Failed auth attempt monitoring
- [ ] Invalid ID attempt tracking
- [ ] Unusual transaction patterns
- [ ] API abuse detection
- [ ] Error rate monitoring

### 🧪 Security Testing
- [ ] Run ESLint security rules
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan (npm audit)
- [ ] SQL injection testing
- [ ] XSS testing
- [ ] Auth bypass testing
- [ ] Rate limit testing

### 📝 Documentation & Process
- [ ] Security incident response plan
- [ ] Admin access audit log
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Security update process
- [ ] Third-party service security review
- [ ] Data retention policies

## 🔄 Automated Security Checks (CI/CD)

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Add to .husky/pre-commit
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm audit --production
```

### GitHub Actions Security Workflow
```yaml
name: Security Checks
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run ESLint Security Rules
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Check for Secrets
        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
      - name: Dependency Audit
        run: npm audit --production
      - name: TypeScript Strict Check
        run: npm run typecheck
```

## 📋 Manual Verification Steps

1. **ID Validation Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test invalid IDs are rejected
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/api/users/invalid-id
   # Should return 400 with "Invalid user ID format"
   ```

2. **Transformer Verification**
   ```bash
   # Ensure no raw DB objects in responses
   grep -r "res.json(.*await db" server/src/
   # Should return no results
   ```

3. **Console.log Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Find remaining console statements
   grep -r "console\." server/src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules
   ```

4. **Secret Scanning**
   ```bash
   # Check for hardcoded secrets
   grep -r -E "(password|secret|key|token).*=.*['\"]" server/src/
   ```
