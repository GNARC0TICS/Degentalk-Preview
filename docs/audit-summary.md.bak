# Documentation Audit Summary (YYYY-MM-DD)

(TODO: Update date)

This report summarizes the initial audit and scaffolding pass for project documentation.

## Directory READMEs

### 1. READMEs Created (Placeholders)
The following directories were missing `README.md` files. Placeholders have been created with `## Status: TODO`.

*   `server/README.md`
*   `shared/README.md`
*   `config/README.md`
*   `docs/README.md`

### 2. Existing READMEs - Status Update

*   **`client/README.md`**
    *   Status: ✅ Up to Date (Restructuring in progress)
    *   Notes: Contains good initial structure but needs to be updated to reflect the ongoing feature-based restructuring.
*   **`db/README.md`**
    *   Status: ✅ Up to Date (Needs expansion based on full plan)
    *   Notes: Basic structure is present. Requires more detail as per the documentation overhaul plan.
*   **`scripts/README.md`**
    *   Status: ✅ Up to Date
    *   Notes: Appears comprehensive and well-maintained.

## Core File Docblocks

### 1. Docblocks Added
Standard header docblocks were added to the following critical files:

*   `server/index.ts`
*   `db/schema/index.ts`

### 2. Files Requiring Docblock Review/Addition (TODO)
A more thorough scan is needed to identify all core files requiring header docblocks. Initial candidates for review include:

*   `client/src/main.tsx`
*   `drizzle.config.ts`
*   `vite.config.ts` (if it exists at root, or `config/vite.config.ts`)
*   `server/routes.ts` (if it's a core aggregator)
*   Key service entry points or utility aggregators.

## Next Steps
1.  Populate the content for all `TODO` READMEs based on the [Documentation Overhaul Plan].
2.  Expand existing READMEs (`client/`, `db/`) as per the plan.
3.  Conduct a deeper audit for core files needing docblocks.
4.  Review and update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` or root `README.md` for overall project guidance.
5.  Update the `last_reviewed` and `owner` fields in the newly added docblocks.
