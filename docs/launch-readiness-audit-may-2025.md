  - Core services exist
  - UI integration incomplete
- **Other Domains:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Vary from 30-80% complete

### Legacy Structure
- **Top-level Routes (`server/*.ts`):** ‚ùå Deprecated 
  - Need migration to domain structure per `route-deprecation.mdc`
- **Services (`server/services/`):** ‚ùå Deprecated
  - Should be moved to appropriate domains
- **Utils (`server/utils/`):** ‚ö†Ô∏è Mix of useful and deprecated
  - Some should be moved to domains, others to core

## Redundancy & Logic Overlap

### Duplicate Utilities
- **Logging:**
  - `server/utils/log.ts`
  - `server/utils/logger.ts`
  - `server/src/utils/logger.ts`
  - **Recommendation:** Consolidate into `server/src/core/logger.ts`

- **API Clients:**
  - `client/src/core/api.ts`
  - `client/src/lib/api.ts`
  - `client/src/lib/api-request.ts`
  - **Recommendation:** Standardize on one approach, move to `client/src/core/api.ts`

- **Query Clients:**
  - `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`
  - `client/src/core/queryClient.ts`
  - **Recommendation:** Consolidate into `client/src/core/queryClient.ts`

### Schema Consistency
- **Issue:** Schema is comprehensive but usage may be inconsistent
- **Affected Areas:**
  - API services may not use proper types
  - Form validation may not match schema constraints
  - Client-side types may drift from server schema
- **Recommendation:** Scan all imports of `shared/schema.ts` and verify type usage

## Conclusion

The Degentalk platform has a solid foundation with significant progress on most core features. The database schema is comprehensive, and many backend services are implemented. However, several critical features require completion before launch, particularly the wallet system, admin tools, and XP system UI integration.

With focused effort on the identified blockers and critical path tasks, the platform could reach launch readiness within 4-6 weeks. Regular progress tracking against the tasks in the refactor-tracker.md file will help ensure steady advancement toward launch.

The modular, domain-driven architecture provides a good foundation for scaling and extending the platform. Continuing to follow the established patterns and best practices will ensure long-term maintainability and performance.
