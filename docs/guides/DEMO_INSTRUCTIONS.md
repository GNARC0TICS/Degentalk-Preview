## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" errors

- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Try logging in again with: `curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'`

### Threads not showing
- Verify the API is returning data: `curl http://localhost:5001/api/forums/content`
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure you're on the correct port (5173 for client)

### Can't create posts
- Ensure you're logged in (auth token set)
- Check that you're not on a locked thread
- Verify the API endpoints are working
