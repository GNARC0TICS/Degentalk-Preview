# Phase-3 â€“ Legacy `req.user` Cleanup

> **Purpose**  Centralise _all_ user-fetch logic behind `userService.getUserFromRequest()` and delete every direct `req.user` access across the backend.

## ðŸ“Š  Current status

* Audit file: `legacy-user-fetch-audit.md`  
  â€“ 394 total occurrences still need manual review.
* All forum domain code and many helpers are already refactored; the remaining hits are spread across other domains.

## ðŸ”€  Work-groups & scope

| Group | Scope (files) | Rough count* | Primary tasks |
|-------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **A** | `*/**/*.controller.ts` | ~118 lines | Replace `req.user` â†’ `userService.getUserFromRequest(req)`.<br>  Ensure extracted `authUser` is reused within the handler. |
| **B** | `*/routes/*.ts` | ~161 lines | Same replacement inside route callbacks.<br>  Route already wrapped in `asyncHandler` â€“ DO NOT touch that. |
| **C** | `*/middleware/*.ts` | ~42 lines | Middleware must call the user-service then attach `req.authUser` (or similar). Never pass raw `req` to services. |
| **D** | `*/services/*.ts` | ~25 lines | Refactor service functions that accept `req` â€“ change to `(userId, ...)`. Update all callers. |
| **E** | "Other" (utils, tests, comments) | ~48 lines | Decide case-by-case:<br>  â€“ keep (e.g. in central auth glue)<br>  â€“ delete / refactor<br>  â€“ ignore if only a comment. |

\*Exact line counts are from the 2025-06-29 audit; may fluctuate as PRs merge.

## ðŸ“‚  Getting your TODO list

```bash
# example for Group A (controllers)
grep ' | controller |' legacy-user-fetch-audit.md > controllers.todo

# unique file paths only
cut -d'|' -f1 controllers.todo | cut -d':' -f1 | sort -u > controllers-files.txt
```

Do the same with `routes`, `middleware`, `service`, `other` to produce a clean per-group checklist.

Commit these `*.todo / *-files.txt` helper lists (or paste into Notion/Sheets) so progress can be tracked.

## ðŸ”§  Coding guidelines (all groups)

1. **The one true way**
   ```ts
   const authUser = userService.getUserFromRequest(req)!;
   const userId   = authUser.id;
   ```
   Never access `req.user` directly.
2. Delete local helpers such as `getUserId(req)` â€“ they're obsolete.
3. If a service/middleware needs the user, pass `authUser` or `userId`, **not the whole `req`**.
4. Don't re-introduce new direct user reads or new helper wrappers.
5. After finishing your edits:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/codemods/identify-legacy-user-fetch.ts --markdown /tmp/recheck.md
   ```
   Your category should report **zero** matches before committing.
6. Small, focused commits â€“ use pattern:
   `refactor(<category>): remove req.user in <domain>`

## ðŸ“¤  Deliverables & PR requirements

* One PR per group, branched off **feat/visual-config-phase1**.
* Title: `Phase-3 | <Group> â€“ remove legacy user-fetch`.
* PR description **must** include:
  * List of files touched.
  * "Closes audit rows â€¦" reference (helpful for tracking).
  * Confirmation that the scanner reports zero actionable matches in the group scope.
* CI must pass; the `identify-legacy-user-fetch` script will be part of CI soon.

---

## âœ…  Definition of done

* `npx tsx scripts/codemods/identify-legacy-user-fetch.ts` prints:
  ```
  ðŸŽ‰  No legacy user-fetch patterns found.
  ```
* ESLint rule disallowing `req.user` (outside auth glue) is added and passes.
* Documentation (this file) updated to reflect completion.
