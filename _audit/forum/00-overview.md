### Forum Codebase Audit

*Timestamp: 2025-06-14*

#### Overview
This audit reviews all forum-related source code across backend, frontend, shared utilities, and database schema.  The goal is to surface redundancies, data-flow problems, schema mismatches, and DX/performance issues.  Non-code artefacts (markdown/docs) are **explicitly excluded** from analysis per requirements.
