## 🏆 The Scoreboard
| Zone | Completion | Energy Level |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Technical Debt Massacre** | ✅ 90% | Code no longer makes devs cry |
| **Performance Juice** | ✅ 85% | Faster than a rug pull |
| **UI Polish** | ⚠️ 40% | Still looks like 2021 DeFi |

### 🎯 What We've Already Shipped (The Good Shit)
- **ThreadCard** that doesn't query the DB 47 times per render
- **PostCard** that actually respects XP multipliers
- Virtualised scrolling so degens can doomscroll 10,000 posts
- Killed 200+ `console.log` calls (RIP debug spam)
- Bundle size down 30% (your mom's laptop can now load it)

## 🚀 THE HIT LIST: What Ships Next
*Ordered by impact × urgency × degen appeal. Each task includes WHY it matters for DegenTalk.*

### 🎨 Priority 1: Dynamic Theming (The Vibe Machine)
**Why This Matters:** Forums are tribes. Tribes need colors. Dynamic themes = instant zone personality.

- [ ] **DB-Backed Themes** – Move `ZONE_THEMES` to database
  - *Impact:* Admins can create "Blood Red Bear Market" theme in 2 clicks
  - *Implementation:* `ui_themes` table with HSL values + WebSocket updates
  - *Degen Feature:* Theme changes based on market conditions (green/red candles)

- [ ] **Live Theme Override** – Admin panel with instant preview
  - *Why:* Zone mods can match themes to current memecoin meta
  - *Tech:* React Context + CSS variables, no page reload needed

- [ ] **Theme Marketplace** (Stretch Goal)
  - Users submit themes, vote with tips
  - Best themes become NFTs (I know, I know, but hear me out)

### 🔒 Priority 2: Type Safety (Don't Get Rugged by Your Own Code)
**Why This Matters:** One mismatched type = exploits, data loss, or worse... boring error pages.

- [ ] **Contract Enforcement** – Single source of truth via `drizzle-codegen`
  - *Current Pain:* Backend returns `user_id`, frontend expects `userId` 
  - *Solution:* Generate types from DB schema → `forum-sdk` → everywhere
  - *Test:* Break a type on purpose, CI should scream

- [ ] **OpenAPI Docs** – Auto-generate at `/api/docs`
  - *Why:* Third-party bots need to shill threads programmatically
  - *Bonus:* Include WebSocket event schemas for real-time features

### 🏗️ Priority 3: Forum Structure (Make It Make Sense)
**Why This Matters:** Current structure is more complex than DeFi yield farming. Simplify or die.

- [ ] **Flatten The Hierarchy** – Kill nested confusion
  - *Problem:* `primaryZones[0].categories[1].forums[0]` (wtf?)
  - *Solution:* Flat structure with `parentId` relationships
  - *Migration:* Write shim, test extensively, then nuke old code

- [ ] **Smart Defaults** – Every zone/forum works out of the box
  - Default XP multipliers based on zone type
  - Auto-generate degen-appropriate placeholder content

### 💎 Priority 4: User Flow Polish (The Dopamine Highway)
**Why This Matters:** Every click should feel like hitting a 100x. Current UX feels like filing taxes.

- [ ] **Zone Pages** – Focus on the vibe, not the threads
  - Show zone leaderboard, hot tips, rising degens
  - Big "Enter Zone" button with particle effects
  - Zone-specific memes/inside jokes in the header

- [ ] **Thread Creation** – Make it feel important
  - "Shill Your Thesis" instead of "Create Thread"
  - Auto-suggest provocative titles based on content
  - Preview how much XP they'll earn for engagement

- [ ] **Reaction System** – Not just likes, full degen emotions
  - 🚀 (bullish), 💎 (diamond hands), 🤡 (cope), 🔥 (this aged well)
  - Reactions affect thread temperature algorithm
  - Special reactions unlocked by XP level

### 🧪 Priority 5: Testing (Don't Ship Broken Shit)
**Why This Matters:** Nothing kills hype like a broken forum during a token launch.

- [ ] **E2E Scenarios** – Test real degen behavior
  1. **The FOMO Flow**: Visitor sees hot thread → registers → posts immediately
  2. **The Whale Flow**: Power user creates thread, gets tipped, tips others
  3. **The Mod Power Trip**: Admin locks forum during "maintenance" (price dump)

- [ ] **Chaos Monkey** – Random XP multiplier changes
  - Test that UI updates without breaking
  - Ensure calculations remain consistent

### 🎪 Priority 6: The Fun Stuff (Ship After Core Is Solid)

- [ ] **XP Animations** – Make numbers go brrrrr
  - Particle effects on level up
  - Screen shake on big tips
  - Achievement unlocks with sound

- [ ] **Easter Eggs** – Hidden features for true degens
  - Konami code unlocks "Turbo Mode"
  - Type "wagmi" for rainbow text
  - 69/420 post counts get special badges

- [ ] **AI Shitpost Detector** – Flag low-effort content
  - "This post glows" warning
  - Community votes on AI probability
  - XP penalty for confirmed bots

## 📊 Success Metrics
Track these to know we're winning:
- **Page Load**: < 1s (faster than checking portfolio)
- **Time to First Shitpost**: < 30s for new users
- **Daily Active Degens**: Track unique posters, not just lurkers
- **XP Velocity**: Average XP/hour should increase weekly
- **Meme Freshness**: Original content ratio > 60%

## 🛠️ How to Use This Guide

1. **Pick a section based on current energy:**
   - Feeling sharp? → Type Safety or Testing
   - Feeling creative? → UI Polish or Fun Stuff
   - Feeling burned out? → Quick wins in Dynamic Theming

2. **Every PR title starts with:** `[DEGEN-{number}]`
   - Makes it easy to track what shipped when

3. **Definition of Done:**
   - Works on mobile (degens trade from toilets)
   - Has at least one degen touch (naming, animation, easter egg)
   - Won't break when 10,000 apes rush in

4. **If stuck, ask:**
   - "Would this make someone screenshot and share?"
   - "Does this respect the degen's time and dopamine?"
   - "Is this better than Discord/Reddit/Twitter?"

## 🎰 The Endgame
When this ships complete, DegenTalk becomes:
- The fastest forum in Web3 (technically)
- The most entertaining forum in Web3 (culturally)  
- The forum where alpha actually gets shared (financially)
- The place CT screenshots for laughs (socially)

Every task completed gets us closer to legendary status. Ship fast, ship fun, ship forever.
