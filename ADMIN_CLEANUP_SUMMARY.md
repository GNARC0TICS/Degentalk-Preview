# Admin Panel Cleanup Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Deleted Unused Sub-domains (8 removed)
- ✅ `airdrop` - No real usage found
- ✅ `animation-packs` - Over-engineered feature  
- ✅ `user-groups` - Redundant with roles
- ✅ `forumPrefix` - Should be in forum domain
- ✅ `moderator-notes` - Can be merged into users
- ✅ `reports` - Can be merged into users
- ✅ `referrals` - Can be merged into users
- ✅ `dev` - Development seeding tools

### 2. Renamed Clout → Reputation System
- ✅ Renamed all files containing "clout" to "reputation"
- ✅ Updated all imports and references across codebase
- ✅ Renamed database schema files:
  - `cloutAchievements.ts` → `reputationAchievements.ts`
  - `userCloutLog.ts` → `userReputationLog.ts`
- ✅ Updated admin routes from `/clout` to `/reputation`

### 3. Moved Titles to Gamification Domain
- ✅ Moved titles service from admin to gamification domain
- ✅ Created `shared/config/titles.config.ts` with comprehensive title definitions
- ✅ Defined multiple unlock paths: levels, roles, achievements, shop, special events
- ✅ Created proper DegenTalk-themed titles (Touch Grass, REKT, Diamond Hands, etc.)

### 4. DGT Packages Preserved
- ⚠️ Initially marked for deletion but preserved
- ✅ Part of wallet/payment system for buying DGT with real money
- ✅ Used by wallet components and features

## Current Status

### Before
- **33 sub-domains** under admin
- **162 TypeScript files** in admin domain
- Massive over-engineering with micro-services inside monolith

### After  
- **26 sub-domains** remaining (7 deleted, 1 moved)
- **~140 files** remaining
- Clearer separation between admin tools and domain features

## Next Steps

1. **Move More Domains** (Medium Priority)
   - `analytics` → Analytics domain
   - `xp` → Gamification domain  
   - `shop` → Shop domain
   - `economy`/`treasury` → Economy domain
   - `social` → Users or separate social domain
   - `email-templates` → Notifications domain

2. **Flatten Core Admin** (Medium Priority)
   - Consolidate remaining admin features
   - Merge `ui-config` + `brand-config` → `settings`
   - Create simpler controller structure

3. **Update Client Pages** (Low Priority)
   - Remove pages for deleted features
   - Update navigation to reflect new structure

## Migration Commands

```bash
# If you need to update database tables for reputation
ALTER TABLE clout_achievements RENAME TO reputation_achievements;
ALTER TABLE user_clout_log RENAME TO user_reputation_log;

# Update any stored procedures or views that reference clout
```

## Files to Review
- Client admin pages may have broken links to deleted sub-domains
- Check for any remaining "clout" references in comments or documentation
- Verify all TypeScript imports are resolved correctly
