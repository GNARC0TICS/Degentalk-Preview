# Migrations Archive

This directory contains migration scripts that are no longer actively used or executed by the main migration runner (`run-migrations.ts`).

**Reasons for Archiving:**

*   **One-time Scripts:** Scripts that were run manually once and are no longer needed (e.g., specific data fixes, initial seeding).
*   **Legacy Patterns:** Older migration scripts using outdated patterns (e.g., `applyXYZ` functions) that have been replaced.
*   **Superseded Logic:** Migrations whose changes are now handled by newer migrations or `drizzle-kit`.

**Usage:**

*   **Reference Only:** These scripts are kept primarily for historical reference and potential rollback analysis.
*   **DO NOT RUN:** These scripts should **not** be run automatically or manually in production or development environments unless you have a specific, understood reason for doing so.
*   **DO NOT MODIFY:** Avoid modifying these files; treat them as a historical snapshot.
