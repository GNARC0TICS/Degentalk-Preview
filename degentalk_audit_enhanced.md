# ðŸ“¦ DegenTalk Enhanced Platform Audit & Expansion Plan (v2)

## Executive Summary

This document integrates the operational audit findings and monorepository structural analysis to present a consolidated, high-fidelity assessment of DegenTalkâ€™s feature maturity, system robustness, and production readiness. It delineates current implementation status, identifies architectural and functional deficits, and prescribes a precise roadmap for advancing the platform to enterprise-grade standards.

## Coding Standards for LLM-Generated Contributions

To guarantee that AI-assisted code artifacts adhere to our stringent quality criteria and architectural conventions, all outputs must conform to the following principles:

1. **Type Integrity**: Employ explicit domain types defined within `@schema`, shared type definitions, or Zod validators. Refrain from using `any` or speculative typings.
2. **Schema Validation**: All Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) must undergo rigorous validation via Zod schemas or `validateBody()`. Align validator definitions with those proximal to the feature in the codebase.
3. **Configuration-First**: Do not hardcode business constantsâ€”derive slugs, roles, and action identifiers directly from canonical configuration artifacts (e.g., `forumMap.config.ts`, `economyConfig`, `featureFlags`).
4. **Layered Architecture**: Adhere to DRY principles by reutilizing service modules (e.g., `xpService`, `forumService`, `userService`) and by encapsulating cross-cutting concerns within the service layer.
5. **Instrumentation**: Introduce contextual log statements (`logger.info`, `warn`, `error`) for all conditional branches and side-effectful operations.
6. **Config-Driven Constants**: Abstract numeric thresholds and policy parameters into centralized configuration or constant definitions.

### API Design Principles

- All POST and mutation endpoints must strictly enforce request validation with explicit Zod catch blocks and structured error propagation.
- Return types must be unequivocally declared as `Promise<ApiResponse<T>>` to maintain type safety and consistency.
- New routes should extend existing domain-specific routers (e.g., `xp.routes.ts`, `moderation.routes.ts`) and must be decorated with appropriate middleware (`requireAuth`, `requireRole`).

### Database Interaction Guidelines

- Utilize Drizzle ORM constructs (`eq()`, `and()`, `sql`) in conjunction with table schemas imported from `@schema`.
- Encase bulk or multi-model transactions within `db.transaction(async (tx) => { ... })` contexts to ensure atomicity.
- Validate externally supplied UUIDs using schema-level utilities (e.g., `isUUID()` within Zod refinements).

### Service Layer Conventions

- Complex business logic that spans multiple models or includes non-trivial branching must reside within a dedicated service class under `server/src/domains/<feature>/services/`.
- Auxiliary utilities that facilitate pure transformations or formatting should be implemented in `server/src/utils/` with comprehensive JSDoc annotations.

## 1. XP & Gamification Framework

**Implementation Status: 90%**

The existing system supports granular XP allocation, tiered level progression, and leaderboard analytics. All core endpoints (`/api/xp/award-action`, `/api/xp/user/:userId`, `/api/xp/actions`, `/api/xp/logs/:userId?`) are operational and deliver deterministic behavior.

**Identified Deficiencies:**
- The cooldown enforcement mechanism defined by the `cooldownState` table lacks integration into the award workflow.
- Absence of an event-driven XP multiplier subsystem (e.g., limited-duration double-XP campaigns).
- Administrative utilities for batch-adjusting XP are currently unsupported.

**Expansion Roadmap:**
1. Implement `POST /api/xp/check-cooldown` to programmatically enforce user action limits.
2. Introduce a persistent `xpEvents` model with administrative CRUD endpoints to orchestrate platform-wide multiplier events.
3. Develop `POST /api/xp/bulk-adjust` to facilitate mass adjustments by privileged roles.

## 2. Achievements & Missions

**Implementation Status: 60%**

The system provides robust achievement CRUD operations, composite triggers, and reward disbursement. However, the missions subsystemâ€”comprising task assignment, progress tracking, and reward claimsâ€”remains incomplete.

**Expansion Roadmap:**
- Author a `MissionService` within `domains/gamification/services/mission.service.ts` encapsulating mission retrieval, progress updates, and reward claims.
- Expose RESTful endpoints:
  - `GET /api/gamification/missions` (all missions)
  - `GET /api/gamification/missions/daily` and `/weekly`
  - `POST /api/gamification/missions/:id/progress`
  - `POST /api/gamification/missions/:id/claim`

---

## 3. Moderation Infrastructure

**Implementation Status: Core 95%, Automation 50%**

Full-featured reporting, manual moderation actions, and user sanction workflows are functional. The automated content moderation layer and a unified moderation queue are outstanding.

**Expansion Roadmap:**
- Define `automod_rules` schema with keyword, regex, and heuristic rule types.
- Implement automated scanning endpoint (`POST /api/moderation/automod/scan`) and CRUD for `automod_rules`.
- Consolidate disparate moderation items into `GET /api/moderation/queue`, enabling prioritization and assignment.

---

## 4. Direct Messaging (DMs)

**Implementation Status: 80%**

The messaging subsystem supports threaded conversation retrieval, message soft deletion, and basic send operations.

**Identified Gaps:**
- User blocking and spam mitigation logic (pending `user_blocks` model integration).
- Real-time message delivery via WebSockets.
- Media attachment handling.

**Expansion Roadmap:**
- Integrate user blocking with `POST /api/messaging/block/:userId` and `DELETE` counterpart.
- Emit and consume WebSocket events (`dm:new_message`, `dm:typing`).
- Extend message schema and endpoints to accept multipart/form-data for attachments stored in S3.

---

## 5. Shoutbox System

**Implementation Status: 95%**

Real-time shout channels, command parsing, rate limiting, and moderation are fully realized.

**Outstanding Enhancements:**
- Enable file and media attachments with presigned URL flows.

---

## 6. Thread-Level Interactions

**Implementation Status: 85%**

Core functionalityâ€”bookmarks, DGT tipping, like reactions, and edit historiesâ€”is in place.

**Pending Features:**
- Rich emoji reactions extension.
- Subscriber notifications for followed threads.
- Bulk bookmark management utilities.

---

## 7. Notification Architecture

**Implementation Status: 70%**

In-app notification generation and read-state management are operational.

**Required Next Steps:**
- WebSocket push integration to enable real-time delivery.
- User-configurable notification preferences persisted in `notification_preferences`.

---

## 8. Forum Access Control & Enforcement

**Implementation Status: 70%**

Dynamic permission enforcement via `forumMap.config.ts` and runtime middleware is implemented. Level-based and temporal gating requires augmentation.

**Expansion Roadmap:**
- Persist advanced constraints in a `forum_requirements` table (e.g., level thresholds, achievement prerequisites).
- Adapt runtime validators to reconcile dynamic rule changes without redeployment.

---

## 9. Abuse Detection & Mitigation

**Implementation Status: 60%**

Rate limiting and fundamental spam throttling exist. High-fidelity behavior analysis, content filtering, and CAPTCHA integration are outstanding.

**Expansion Roadmap:**
- Construct a `user_behavior_metrics` repository and analytics pipeline for anomaly detection.
- Implement a `ContentFilterService` for real-time profanity, spam, and security threat identification.
- Integrate CAPTCHA workflows for high-risk endpoints.

---

## Codebase Structural Observations

- The monorepoâ€™s segmentation (`client`, `server`, `shared`, `db`, `scripts`, `config`, `docs`) facilitates clear domain boundaries.
- Canonical configurations (`forumMap.config.ts`, `economyConfig.ts`, `themes.config.ts`) are correctly centralized.
- Redundant documentation under `docs/` and `docs/api/` merits consolidation to a singular authoritative location.
- Migration and seed scripts require reclassification to reflect evolutionary (versus legacy) artifacts.
- CI enhancements: enforce forum sync validation, XP action consistency checks, and feature-flag alignment.

---

## Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1â€“2):** Mission subsystem completion, DM blocking, level-based access gating, content filtration.
**Phase 2 (Weeks 3â€“4):** WebSocket integration across DMs, notifications, shoutbox; XP cooldown enforcement; auto-moderation rollout.
**Phase 3 (Weeks 5â€“6):** Behavioral analytics deployment, push notification infrastructure, media attachment services, advanced search capabilities.
