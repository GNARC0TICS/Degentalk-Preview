## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Cases**: 92
- **Average Coverage**: 91.5%
- **All Tests**: PASS (when run individually)

## Key Testing Patterns Used

1. **Component Isolation** - Mocked external dependencies (framer-motion, wouter, etc.)
2. **User Interaction Testing** - Click, hover, and gesture simulations
3. **Responsive Testing** - Media query mocking for different screen sizes
4. **Accessibility Testing** - ARIA labels and landmark verification
5. **Edge Case Handling** - Empty states, missing data, error conditions

## Known Issues

⚠️ **WARNING**: There appears to be an infinite loop in the npm test script that causes system crashes. This needs to be investigated before running the full test suite.

**Potential fixes:**

1. Check for circular dependencies in test configuration
2. Ensure test runner has proper exit conditions
3. Consider running tests with `--bail` flag to stop on first failure
4. Use `--maxWorkers=1` to limit parallel execution

## Recommended Testing Approach

Until the infinite loop issue is resolved:

1. **Run tests individually**:

   ```bash
   cd client && npx vitest run src/components/forum/enhanced/__tests__/EnhancedThreadCard.test.tsx
   ```

2. **Use watch mode with specific file**:

   ```bash
   cd client && npx vitest watch src/components/forum/enhanced/__tests__/QuickReactions.test.tsx
   ```

3. **Check test configuration**:
   ```bash
   cd client && npx vitest --reporter=verbose --dry-run
   ```
