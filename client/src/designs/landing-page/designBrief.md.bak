- **Purpose:** To announce the upcoming launch of the Degentalk™ application, generate excitement, and capture email leads for launch notifications.
- **Scope:** A single, responsive landing page that is visually aligned with the main Degentalk™ application's aesthetic. It will feature a hero section, key feature highlights, and an email subscription form.

## 3. Target Audience
- Individuals interested in community-driven platforms, potentially with interests in digital collectibles, token-based economies, or specific niche topics that Degentalk™ will cater to.
- Early adopters eager to try new social and interactive platforms.

## 4. User Objectives

- Get a glimpse of key features.
- Easily subscribe to receive email updates about the official launch.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Primary:** Number of email subscriptions.
- **Secondary:** Page views, bounce rate, average time on page.

## 6. Primary Features to Highlight
*(These should be concise and impactful for a landing page. Based on `home.tsx` and general app concepts, examples could be):*
- **Dynamic Community Zones:** "Explore vibrant, topic-focused communities or create your own."
- **Integrated Wallet & Economy:** "Engage with a unique platform economy, manage assets, and participate in token-gated experiences." (If applicable)
- **Real-time Interaction:** "Connect instantly with others through features like the Shoutbox and live discussions."

## 7. Primary Call to Action (CTA)
- "Subscribe for Launch Updates" / "Get Notified on Launch"
- An email input field and a submission button.

## 8. Conversion Goals
- Maximize the number of unique email addresses collected.

## 9. Message & Tone
- **Message:** "Degentalk™ is coming soon. Be the first to experience the next generation of online communities."
- **Tone:** Exciting, modern, innovative, community-focused.

## 10. Visual Style & Branding
- **Theme:** Dark, consistent with `home.tsx` (e.g., `bg-black text-white`, `bg-zinc-900` for cards).
- **Inspiration:** Leverage existing UI components and styles from `home.tsx` such as `HeroSection`, `Card` styles, `Button` styles, and iconography.
- **Logo:** Prominently display the Degentalk™ logo.

## 11. Content Requirements
- Hero section: Compelling headline, sub-headline.
- Feature highlights: Short descriptions for 2-3 key features with icons.
- Subscription form: Email input, submit button, privacy notice/consent.
- Footer: Copyright, minimal links (e.g., to any existing social media or a placeholder for terms/privacy).

## 12. Constraints & Considerations
- The page should be lightweight and fast-loading.
- Mobile responsiveness is crucial.
- Email collection mechanism needs to be decided (e.g., integration with a mailing list service, or simple backend storage). This brief focuses on the frontend design.
