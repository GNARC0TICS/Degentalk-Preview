This document lists all available cursor rules for the ForumFusion project. These rules can be fetched using the `fetch_rules` tool to help with specific coding tasks.

## Core Rules
- **admin-structure**: Guidelines for admin panel building structure
- **context-mup-protocol**: Workflow for starting new task when context window reaches 50%
- **database-cheatsheet**: Reference and maintenance of the database structure documentation
- **dev-env-rules**: Rules and best practices for the development environment (see cline-dev-env-rules.md)
- **cheat-codes**: Refactoring cheat codes for automated code health
- **import-patterns**: Best practices for imports and exports
- **naming-rules**: Conventions for naming files, variables, functions, and components
- **navigation-helper**: Rules for cursor navigation and directory organization
- **route-deprecation**: Guidelines for route organization and migration
- **rule-evolution**: Process for updating and evolving rules
- **update-history**: Log of rule updates and changes

## How to Use
When working on a specific part of the codebase, fetch the relevant rules to guide your work:

```
fetch_rules(["database-cheatsheet", "naming-rules"])
```

Rules provide context-specific guidance and best practices to maintain consistency across the project.
