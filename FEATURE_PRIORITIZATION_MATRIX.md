## Conclusion

DegenTalk is closer to launch than it appears. With focused effort on completing existing features rather than adding new ones, the platform can be live in 1 week and fully featured in 4 weeks.

**Key principles for success:**
1. Ship what works, fix what's broken
2. Remove before adding
3. User feedback drives priority
4. Performance over features
5. Clean code enables speed

The path to launch is clear: remove bloat, fix architecture, ship features, gather feedback, iterate quickly.
