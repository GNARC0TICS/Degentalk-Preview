## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

**Adding Mention Support to New Content Types**:
1. Add mention processing in content creation/update endpoints
2. Use `MentionsService.processMentions()` after content insertion
3. Include mention rendering in display components

**Implementing Whale Detection**:
1. Configure thresholds in `social.config.ts`
2. Use `SocialConfigHelper.isWhale()` for detection
3. Apply whale-specific UI elements (crown badges, etc.)

**Follow System Integration**:
1. Add follow buttons to user profiles and cards
2. Use `FollowsService` for follow operations
3. Implement activity feeds using follow relationships

### For Administrators

**Social Feature Configuration**:
- Modify `social.config.ts` for platform-wide settings
- Adjust whale detection thresholds based on platform metrics
- Configure rate limits to prevent abuse

**Privacy and Moderation**:
- Monitor mention abuse through admin dashboard
- Review follow request patterns for spam detection
- Manage whale status manually if needed

### for Users

**Mention Usage**:
- Type `@username` to mention users in posts, threads, and chat
- Configure notification preferences in user settings
- Use privacy controls to limit who can mention you

**Following Whales**:
- Discover whales through the WhaleWatch dashboard
- Customize notification preferences per followed user
- Use search to find specific users to follow

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

- **Mentions**: Indexed on `mentionedUserId` and `isRead` for fast notification queries
- **Follows**: Indexed on `followerId` and `followedId` for efficient relationship lookups
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory tracking with Redis fallback for production

### Frontend Optimization

- **Mention Autocomplete**: Debounced search with 300ms delay
- **Activity Feeds**: Paginated with infinite scroll
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for instant notifications

### Caching Strategy

- **User Search**: 30-second cache for mention autocomplete
- **Follow Counts**: 5-minute cache for profile display
- **Whale Lists**: 1-hour cache for discovery page

## Security Features

### Privacy Controls

- **Mention Permissions**: Friend-only or follower-only mentions
- **Follow Privacy**: Hidden follower counts and lists
- **Request Approval**: Require approval for follow requests

### Rate Limiting

- **Mentions**: 100 per hour for regular users, higher for mods
- **Follows**: 50 per hour to prevent follow spam
- **Friend Requests**: 20 per day to prevent abuse

### Data Protection

- **Soft Deletes**: Preserve social graph integrity
- **User Blocking**: Prevent unwanted social interactions
- **Admin Override**: Emergency controls for moderation

## Integration with Existing Systems
