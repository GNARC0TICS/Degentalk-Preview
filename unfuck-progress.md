## Progress Log

### Agent 3 Progress (Build & Module Resolution)
- Started with 1,797 errors
- Fixed module resolution by changing to 'bundler' mode
- Fixed duplicate @lib/* path mappings
- Fixed @db imports by updating to @degentalk/db (165 files updated)
- Fixed lib folder not being included in build
- Current: 1,581 errors (216 errors fixed!)

#### Key Findings:
1. TypeScript path mappings (@db) don't work reliably with composite projects
2. Using workspace package names (@degentalk/db) is more reliable
3. Module resolution 'bundler' is required for ESM compatibility
4. Build configs must include all source directories (lib was missing)

#### Remaining Issues:
1. Shared types importing from @db/schema/core/enums (needs investigation)
2. Some transformers importing non-existent types from schema
3. Schema boolean assignment errors in db package
4. Missing properties in relations files

### Agent 4 Progress (Schema & Type Overloads)
- Started with 1797 errors (after other agents' work)
- Fixed environment.ts zod defaults (7 fixes)
- Fixed Redis options (removed retryDelayOnFailover)
- Fixed WalletError ErrorCodes usage (7 fixes)
- Fixed logger calls missing namespace (10+ fixes)
- Fixed DgtAmount conversions using toDgtAmount()
- Fixed schema boolean errors with pick() instead of omit()
- Current: 1799 errors (investigating new errors)

#### Key Patterns Fixed:
1. Zod schemas: Use string defaults for transforms (e.g., '5001' not 5001)
2. WalletError: Use ErrorCodes enum values, not numeric codes
3. Logger: Always provide namespace as first argument
4. DgtAmount: Always use toDgtAmount() helper, never cast
5. Drizzle schemas: Use pick() instead of omit() to avoid type issues
