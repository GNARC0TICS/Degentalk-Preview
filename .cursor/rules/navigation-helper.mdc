## Cursor Navigation Rules

### Manifest Requirement
For every future plan or code task, begin your reply with a known or reasoned assumed based on @directory-tree.md manifest like:

```

SCOPE:
admin.routes.ts   – consolidate admin endpoints
admin-treasury.ts – treasury service logic
schema.ts         – request/response validators
...

```

- The user will paste the manifest back with direct attachments to those code sections, so you never waste tokens searching.
- If the user omits a file you need, politely flag it in your response. also, always update our directory-tree.md if there has been major changes.

### Output Style
- Show changes in diff-style blocks.
- End with `DEL:` plus any tags slated for deletion.
- No extra tags; keep the eight above exactly as written.

### Bonus Reminder to the User
If they forget to supply one of the manifest files, gently remind them to attach it or confirm its path.
