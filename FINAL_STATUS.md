# Next.js Migration - Final Status

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### Critical Files Restored
1. **UIConfigContext** - The most important file for the landing page UI configuration
2. **All Pages** - About, Contact, Privacy, Terms pages restored with proper imports
3. **Header & Footer Components** - Restored for complete layout
4. **CSS Files** - All component CSS files restored
5. **Images** - Background images and assets copied

### Fixes Applied
1. **Carousel Autoplay** - Fixed with dynamic imports (client-side only)
2. **Environment Variables** - Converted from Vite to Next.js format
3. **React Router** - All imports updated to use router-compat
4. **Client Directives** - Added "use client" to all necessary components
5. **Link Components** - Changed from `to` to `href` prop

### Current State
- ✅ Landing page fully functional with all styles
- ✅ All pages accessible (Home, About, Contact, Privacy, Terms)
- ✅ CSS styling properly loaded
- ✅ Images and assets in place
- ✅ Dev server running without errors

### Note on Build
The app pages are using the App Router while importing from pages directory, which is the intended hybrid approach for this migration.

The landing page is now fully functional with all original styling and features restored!
