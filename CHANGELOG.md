## Migration Notes

### Import Alias Migration (July 2025)

If you have branches created before this migration, you'll need to update imports:

```bash
# For client files
find client/src -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" \) | while read file; do 
  sed -i "s/@app\//@\//g" "$file"
done

# For server files
find server/src -type f -name "*.ts" | while read file; do 
  sed -i "s/@api\//@\//g; s/@server\//@\//g; s/@server-core\//@core\//g" "$file"
done
```

Then run `pnpm typecheck` to verify everything compiles correctly.
